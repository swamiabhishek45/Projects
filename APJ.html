                <h2>Missile Man of India</h2>
                <p><b> Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</b> was an Indian aerospace scientist and statesman who
                    served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil
                    Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist
                    and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and
                    Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian space
                    programme and military missile development efforts. He thus came to be known as the Missile Man
                    of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle
                    technology. He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in
                    India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in
                    1974.</p>
